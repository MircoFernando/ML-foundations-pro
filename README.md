# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Foundations Project
## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning Foundations course to gain hands-on experience in implementing fundamental ML algorithms from scratch.

I implemented:

Linear Regression (with gradient descent)

Polynomial Regression

Logistic Regression (binary classification: Pass/Fail)

Evaluation Metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC/AUC)

Scikit-learn comparison to validate and benchmark results

The project helped me deeply understand how ML algorithms work under the hood.

## âš¡ Features

Implemented gradient descent for optimization.

Added bias term & feature scaling for stable convergence.

Built polynomial regression for non-linear relationships.

Implemented sigmoid activation & cross-entropy loss for classification.

Manually computed classification metrics (confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1).

Visualized regression curves and decision boundaries.

Compared with Scikit-learn implementations for verification.
